# TerminalHacker
This is a project inspired form the GameDev project in Unity with changes in the code and in the core gameplay.
This is only the script file written in c#.
In this game the player has to solve little problems to obtain the key to break into the wi-fi of Starbucks, NASA and of a police station. 
There are three level of difficulty.
The player must write on a terminal emulated by me in Unity, that C# project is missing because of Copyright politics.
